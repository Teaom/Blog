# Tech-Bloogers      ![my badge](https://badgen.net/badge/liscense/None/blue)

## Description:
-This application is a really rough example of a blog that uses mySql, sequalize, controllers, handlebars aswell as front and back end JavaScript. You are able to see posts on the homepage, sign up or login. Once logged in you can visit a dashboard that displays your personal posts. You can create, edit or delete a post. You can comment on posts. Again, its very rough and I would like to do more to it but then again I would just use React. Thanks for looking!
